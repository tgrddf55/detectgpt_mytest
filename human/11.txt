He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, 
nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions 
on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He 
never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled 
his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the 
boy. He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that 
soon he would be rowing.
