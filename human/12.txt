“Qua Va,” the boy said. “It is what a man must do.” 
They walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot 
men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats. 
When they reached the old man’s shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the 
harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.
