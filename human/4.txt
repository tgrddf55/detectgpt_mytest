They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the 
boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon 
with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was 
used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the old 
man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, 
though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and 
a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.
