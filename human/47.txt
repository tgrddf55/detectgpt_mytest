“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. “We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy.”
Hagrid frowned at him.
“O’ course I can't,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”
“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”
Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.
