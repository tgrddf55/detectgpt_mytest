The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he 
should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a 
bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day. 
The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they 
went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid 
her into the water.
