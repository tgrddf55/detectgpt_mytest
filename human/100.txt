“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”
Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
“What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.
“Can't tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that.”
Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.
