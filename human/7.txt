I go now for the sardines,” the boy said. 
When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy 
took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old 
man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still 
strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen 
forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were 
faded to many different shades by the sun. The [18] old man’s head was very old though and with 
his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his 
arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted. 
The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep.
