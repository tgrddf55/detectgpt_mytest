The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest 
lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used 
before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and 
attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so 
that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils 
which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out 
over three hundred fathoms of line.
