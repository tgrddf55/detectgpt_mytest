“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.
“There's a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself.
“'Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.”
“But what does a Ministry of Magic do ?”
“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”
