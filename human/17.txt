The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with 
the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he 
looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the 
sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he 
was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the 
water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the 
land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but 
some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, 
gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating dose beside the boat. It turned on its side 
and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing 
a yard behind it in the water. 
“Agua mala,” the man said. “You whore.”
