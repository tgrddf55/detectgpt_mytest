“What a fish,” he said. “He has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it.” 
Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew that if you 
said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him 
moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth. At that moment he felt him 
stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the weight increased and he gave more line. He 
tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was 
going straight down.
