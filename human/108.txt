“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.
“That's Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. “He works at Hogwarts.”

“He's the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.
