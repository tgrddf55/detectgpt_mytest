They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.
“I won't let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert's at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can't handle.”
When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.
“Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot — jus’ playin’ — he's only a baby, after all.”
