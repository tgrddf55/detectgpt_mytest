The rise of streaming services like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube has changed the way people consume media. Instead of purchasing physical copies of music, movies, or TV shows, consumers can now access vast libraries of content on demand. This shift has led to the decline of traditional media industries, such as DVD rentals and music sales. Additionally, streaming services have enabled the rise of original content production, with companies like Netflix investing heavily in creating their own movies and TV series. As streaming continues to dominate the media landscape, its impact on traditional media will only grow.
