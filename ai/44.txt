The concept of blockchain technology has gained significant attention in recent years, primarily due to its association with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. At its core, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner. Each "block" contains a set of transactions and is linked to the previous block, creating a chain. This structure makes it extremely difficult to alter or tamper with the data, ensuring the integrity of the transactions. Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain is being explored for applications in supply chain management, healthcare, and digital contracts.
