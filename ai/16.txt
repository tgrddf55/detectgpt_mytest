Global health initiatives have played a significant role in improving health outcomes and reducing mortality rates worldwide. Programs focused on vaccination, sanitation, and nutrition have led to dramatic decreases in preventable diseases and improved quality of life for millions. However, health disparities persist, particularly in low-income countries, where access to healthcare remains limited. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure, ensuring the availability of essential medicines, and addressing the social determinants of health are vital to achieving health equity and improving global health outcomes.
