The process of problem-solving in software development often involves breaking down a large issue into smaller, manageable parts. Developers typically start by understanding the core issue and identifying potential solutions. Then, they test these solutions iteratively, making adjustments as needed. The feedback from testing helps refine the solution. Often, developers will also consider the long-term maintainability of their solution, ensuring that the code is not only functional but also efficient and easy to modify in the future. This iterative process is essential in creating reliable and scalable software systems.
