Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming various industries, from healthcare to finance. In healthcare, AI systems are being developed to assist doctors in diagnosing diseases more accurately and quickly. For example, machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images and detect patterns that are difficult for the human eye to see. In finance, AI is used to predict stock market trends and assist with investment decisions. As AI technology advances, its applications are expected to expand further, revolutionizing industries by improving decision-making, increasing efficiency, and reducing human error.
