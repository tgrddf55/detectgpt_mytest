Sustainable agriculture is becoming increasingly important as the global population continues to grow, putting pressure on food production systems. Conventional farming practices can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity, making it essential to adopt more sustainable methods. Techniques such as crop rotation, agroforestry, and organic farming can reduce the environmental impact of agriculture while improving yields. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as precision farming and vertical farming, are helping farmers optimize resource use and reduce waste. As the demand for food grows, sustainable agriculture will play a crucial role in feeding the world while protecting the environment.
