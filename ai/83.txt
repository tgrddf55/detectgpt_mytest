The gig economy, characterized by short-term, flexible jobs, has seen significant growth in recent years. Companies like Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit have created new opportunities for individuals to earn income by offering their services on demand. For workers, the gig economy provides flexibility and the ability to choose when and how much they work. However, gig workers often face challenges such as lack of job security, benefits, and fair wages. As the gig economy continues to expand, there is a growing need for policies that protect workers' rights and ensure fair compensation.
