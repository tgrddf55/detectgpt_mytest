Artificial intelligence is increasingly being integrated into daily life, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation algorithms on streaming platforms. AI is helping people in various aspects of life, from making decisions to automating mundane tasks. However, its widespread use also raises concerns about privacy, data security, and bias in decision-making. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential to develop regulations that safeguard individuals' rights, ensure transparency, and prevent misuse, while also fostering innovation and the positive applications of AI.
