"Smart cities are urban areas that use digital technology to improve the quality of life for residents, enhance sustainability, and optimize resource management. These cities integrate technologies such as sensors, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor and manage infrastructure, transportation, and public services. While smart cities offer many potential benefits, including reduced energy consumption and improved public safety, there are also concerns about privacy, security, and data collection. Ensuring that smart cities are designed with the needs of all citizens in mind is essential to their success."
