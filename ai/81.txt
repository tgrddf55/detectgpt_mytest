The rise of e-commerce has transformed the way we shop and do business. Online shopping offers convenience, allowing consumers to browse and purchase products from the comfort of their homes. The growth of e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, has also spurred the development of new business models, including dropshipping and subscription services. As more people turn to online shopping, traditional brick-and-mortar stores have been forced to adapt or face closure. The e-commerce industry continues to evolve, with emerging trends such as personalized shopping experiences, virtual reality, and AI-driven recommendations shaping the future of retail.
