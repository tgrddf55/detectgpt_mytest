The fashion industry is undergoing a transformation driven by sustainability and ethical practices. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of fast fashion, which has led to a rise in demand for sustainable alternatives. Brands are embracing eco-friendly materials, reducing waste, and ensuring fair labor practices in their supply chains. Additionally, the rise of second-hand clothing and clothing rental services reflects a shift toward a more circular fashion economy. As consumers become more conscious of their purchasing decisions, the fashion industry is adapting to meet the demand for sustainability and ethical practices.
