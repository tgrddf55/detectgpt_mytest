Artificial intelligence is increasingly being applied to creative fields such as art, music, and literature. AI algorithms can generate artwork, compose music, and even write poetry, challenging traditional notions of creativity and authorship. While AI can enhance artistic expression, it also raises questions about originality, ownership, and the role of human artists. As AI continues to play a larger role in creative processes, it is important to consider the ethical implications of machine-generated content and to ensure that human creativity remains central to artistic expression.
