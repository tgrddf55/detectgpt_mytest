The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect and exchange data. IoT devices range from smart home appliances, such as thermostats and refrigerators, to industrial machines that monitor production lines. The data collected by these devices can be used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance user experiences. However, the rapid growth of IoT has also raised concerns about data security and privacy, as more devices become interconnected and collect personal information.
