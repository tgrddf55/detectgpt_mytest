In modern web development, front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue have become essential tools for building interactive and dynamic websites. React, for example, uses a component-based architecture that allows developers to create reusable UI components, improving code maintainability. Angular, developed by Google, provides a full-fledged framework with built-in solutions for routing, state management, and HTTP requests. Vue is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a favorite for smaller projects or developers looking for a lightweight solution. Each of these frameworks has its strengths and is widely used across the industry.
