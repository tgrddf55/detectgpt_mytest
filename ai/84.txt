The concept of smart cities is gaining momentum as urban areas strive to become more sustainable, efficient, and livable. Smart cities leverage technology, such as sensors, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT), to improve public services, reduce energy consumption, and enhance quality of life. For example, smart traffic systems can reduce congestion and improve air quality by optimizing traffic flow. In addition, smart waste management systems can reduce waste and promote recycling. As more cities adopt smart technologies, the potential for creating smarter, more sustainable urban environments continues to grow.
