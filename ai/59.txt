Augmented reality (AR) technology overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the way we interact with our environment. AR has gained significant popularity in applications like gaming, where it allows players to interact with virtual objects in real-world settings. For example, the mobile game Pokémon Go used AR to place virtual Pokémon in real-world locations, encouraging players to explore their surroundings. AR is also being used in industries like retail, where it allows customers to try on virtual clothing or preview how furniture will look in their homes. As AR technology improves, its applications will continue to expand.
