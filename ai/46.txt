In the realm of cybersecurity, ethical hacking plays a crucial role in identifying vulnerabilities in systems before malicious hackers can exploit them. Ethical hackers, also known as penetration testers, are hired by organizations to perform controlled attacks on their systems, networks, or applications. This proactive approach helps to uncover potential weaknesses and provides organizations with the opportunity to fix them before they are targeted. Ethical hackers use a variety of tools and techniques to simulate real-world attacks, ensuring that the organization's defenses are robust enough to withstand actual cyber threats.
