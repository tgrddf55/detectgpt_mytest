Cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses approach technology infrastructure. By utilizing cloud services, companies can access computing resources on demand, eliminating the need for maintaining expensive on-site hardware. Major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer a wide range of services, from virtual machines to databases and machine learning tools. Cloud computing also enables scalability, allowing businesses to quickly adjust their resources based on changing needs. As more companies migrate to the cloud, the adoption of cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes and microservices continues to grow.
