The adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is crucial in the fight against climate change. These sources of energy produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, making them an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels. Governments around the world are incentivizing the transition to renewable energy through subsidies, tax credits, and regulations. Additionally, advances in energy storage technologies, such as batteries, are making it easier to store renewable energy for use when demand is high or when the sun isn't shining, or the wind isn't blowing.
