The development of self-driving cars has the potential to significantly change the transportation industry. Autonomous vehicles use a combination of sensors, cameras, and machine learning algorithms to navigate roads without human intervention. This technology promises to improve road safety by reducing human error, which is responsible for the majority of traffic accidents. Additionally, self-driving cars could reduce traffic congestion and improve fuel efficiency. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome, such as regulatory issues, technological limitations, and public acceptance of autonomous vehicles.
