The concept of digital twins refers to virtual replicas of physical objects or systems that can be used to simulate and analyze real-world conditions. These digital models can be used in various industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and urban planning. For example, in manufacturing, a digital twin of a factory can help optimize production processes and predict equipment failures before they happen. In healthcare, digital twins can be used to model a patient's condition and test different treatment options. As technology advances, digital twins are becoming increasingly sophisticated, enabling businesses to make more informed decisions.
