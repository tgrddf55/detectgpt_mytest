Urbanization is a global trend that has led to the rapid growth of cities, with more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas. While cities offer economic opportunities, access to services, and cultural diversity, they also face challenges such as overcrowding, pollution, and strain on infrastructure. Sustainable urban development requires thoughtful planning, investment in green technologies, and the implementation of policies that prioritize environmental and social well-being. Ensuring that cities remain livable, inclusive, and resilient to future challenges is key to supporting urban populations.
