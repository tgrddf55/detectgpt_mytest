Data privacy has become a critical concern as the amount of personal information shared online continues to grow. With numerous data breaches and privacy scandals in recent years, there has been an increasing demand for stronger privacy protections. Governments around the world have responded by implementing stricter regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. These regulations require companies to be transparent about how they collect and use personal data, and they also give individuals more control over their information. As privacy concerns grow, businesses must adapt to meet the evolving legal and ethical standards.
