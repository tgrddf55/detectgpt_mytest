The development of smart home technology has made it easier for people to control various aspects of their homes remotely. Smart thermostats, lighting systems, and security cameras can now be controlled through mobile apps, offering convenience and energy savings. For example, smart thermostats learn users' preferences and adjust the temperature automatically, helping to reduce energy consumption. Smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home serve as central hubs for controlling other devices, allowing users to manage their homes with simple voice commands. As the smart home market grows, new innovations continue to emerge.
