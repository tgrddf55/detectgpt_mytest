"Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are immersive technologies that are changing the way people interact with digital content. VR creates entirely virtual environments, while AR overlays digital information onto the real world. These technologies are being used in various fields, including entertainment, education, healthcare, and training. As VR and AR continue to evolve, they offer new opportunities for innovation and creativity. However, challenges such as high costs, accessibility, and the potential for motion sickness must be addressed to make these technologies widely accessible and user-friendly."
