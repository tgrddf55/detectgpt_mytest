The concept of a "smart city" is centered around using technology to improve the quality of life for residents while making urban environments more sustainable and efficient. Smart cities integrate various technologies, such as IoT devices, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, to manage resources like energy, transportation, and waste. For example, smart traffic lights can adjust their timing based on traffic patterns, reducing congestion. Additionally, sensors can monitor air quality, alerting authorities to pollution levels. As cities continue to grow, the implementation of smart technologies will play a key role in addressing urban challenges.
