The popularity of e-commerce has dramatically changed the retail landscape. With the rise of online shopping platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, consumers now have access to a wide variety of products with just a few clicks. This shift has forced traditional brick-and-mortar stores to adapt by offering online shopping options and improving their in-store experiences. E-commerce has also led to the growth of new business models, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer sales. As technology continues to evolve, the future of retail will likely be shaped by further innovations in e-commerce.
