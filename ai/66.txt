The rise of social media platforms has transformed the way people communicate and interact online. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allow users to share their thoughts, experiences, and content with a global audience. This shift has had a profound impact on marketing, as businesses can now reach their target audiences more directly through social media ads and influencer partnerships. However, social media has also raised concerns about privacy, misinformation, and mental health. As these platforms continue to evolve, their influence on society will likely remain a topic of discussion and debate.
