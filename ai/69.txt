The concept of edge computing is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional cloud computing. In edge computing, data is processed closer to the source of the data, rather than being sent to a centralized cloud server. This reduces latency and can improve the performance of applications that require real-time processing, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial monitoring systems. Additionally, edge computing can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over networks, leading to cost savings and improved efficiency. As more devices become interconnected, edge computing is expected to play a key role in the future of technology.
