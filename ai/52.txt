Quantum computing is an emerging field that promises to revolutionize the way we process information. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to represent data as either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits), which can represent multiple states simultaneously due to the principles of superposition and entanglement. This allows quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers. While the technology is still in its early stages, quantum computing has the potential to impact fields such as cryptography, material science, and artificial intelligence.
