The increasing reliance on digital systems has made cybersecurity more important than ever. As more personal, financial, and business data is stored online, the risk of cyberattacks grows. Cybercriminals use various methods, including phishing, malware, and ransomware, to gain unauthorized access to systems and steal valuable information. To protect against these threats, organizations must implement robust security measures, such as encryption, multi-factor authentication, and regular security audits. Additionally, cybersecurity awareness training for employees is essential in preventing attacks that target human vulnerabilities.
