The popularity of plant-based diets has surged in recent years, driven by concerns about health, animal welfare, and the environment. Plant-based eating focuses on foods derived from plants, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains, while minimizing or eliminating animal products. Studies have shown that plant-based diets can lower the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, and contribute to weight loss. Additionally, plant-based diets have a lower environmental impact, requiring fewer resources and producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions than meat production. As awareness grows, more people are adopting plant-based diets for a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.
